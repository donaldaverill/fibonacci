# Fibonacci

This is a sandbox repository for learning about git workflows. We're using the Fibonacci sequence with various programming languages because it's a fun thing to do.

Included fibonacci functions originate from [RosettaCode.org](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence). 

For the .NET C# and F# projects try [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Get started with VS Code using C# and .NET Core on Windows](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/dotnet/Get-started-with-VS-Code-using-CSharp-and-NET-Core). Be sure to run 
```
dotnet restore
```

#### C#
